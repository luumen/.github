## Welcome to Hatchfi's GitHub!

We're building an API that empowers financial products to connect to their users' cryptocurrency data in just a few hours, not weeks or months.

### üßë‚Äçüíª By developers, for developers

An age-old saying, but we mean it.

- Carlos, our CEO, has been an engineer in DevOps since the early 10s and has been building startups for years.
- Casey, our CTO, has been hacking and building products for over ten years!

What does this even mean? By developers, for developers? Well, it's simple. We're here to make your life easier. Crypto data can be confusing, unorganized, and outright hard to read. As a result, we've been on a mission to help developers skip the tedious work of finding, connecting, parsing, storing, and displaying cryptocurrency data from dozens of sources.

### üêò Our humble beginnings 

We started in the crypto space by building Luumen Finance, a web3 mint.com. As you can imagine, we faced a significant entry barrier when faced with integrations. We found ourselves asking questions like:

- Is this a good API for this chain?
- Does this exchange have an API we can access?
- What's the rate limit here?
- Why do these all have different data structures and designs?

We found that a few people were trying to solve this issue, but they didn't provide the data we needed, accurate data from the blockchain.

### Thank you

As we build the Hatchfi ecosystem, we face huge hurdles that we're solving for developers like you. We appreciate the feedback, as honest as you can be. We appreciate you using our API. We appreciate you building and connecting the world to Web3.
